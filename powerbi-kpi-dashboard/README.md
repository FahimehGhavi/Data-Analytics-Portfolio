### 🧩 The Business Need

Decision-makers wanted a clear overview of the data professional community:
- Which roles and countries are most represented?
- How much do data professionals earn?
- Which programming languages are most popular?
- How happy are they with their salary and work–life balance?

The goal was to build an interactive dashboard that summarizes these survey results in a simple, visual way.

### 🔍 What I Did

- Loaded the survey data from an Excel file into **Power BI**
- Used **Power Query** to:
  - remove empty or invalid rows  
  - fix data types (numeric fields, age, salary, etc.)  
  - standardize values such as country and job title  
- Built a clean data model for analysis
- Created **DAX measures** for:
  - total number of survey takers  
  - average age  
  - average salary  
  - average happiness with salary  
  - average happiness with work–life balance
