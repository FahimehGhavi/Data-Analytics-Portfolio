The dashboard was created to help business stakeholders monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as revenue, customer growth, product category performance, and regional trends. It includes interactive slicers and filters to explore the data across time, geography, and categories.

###  The Business Need

Decision-makers were struggling to keep track of rapidly changing business data across different departments â€” sales, customer service, and product categories. The goal was to build a centralized KPI dashboard that would provide a high-level overview but also allow deep-dive exploration.

###  What I Did

I collected data from Excel spreadsheets and transformed it in Power Query to create a clean data model. Using DAX, I calculated dynamic KPIs such as:

- Total and Monthly Revenue  
- Customer Growth Rate  
- Product Category Performance  
- Sales Trends by Region and Channel

Slicers were added to allow users to filter by time, region, and product line.

###  Key Insights

- Customer growth was **highest in Q2**, driven by promotional campaigns.  
- **Region West** consistently outperformed others in both revenue and customer satisfaction.  
- The **Accessories category** had low revenue but high returns â€” a sign of product quality or mismatch with customer expectations.  
- Some regions had strong sales but weak support ratings â€” indicating a need for **customer service training**.
