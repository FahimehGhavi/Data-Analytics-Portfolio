#  Weather Data Analysis with Python

This project explores historical weather data to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies over multiple years. My goal was to practice data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Python — and to tell a clear story from raw data.

---

###  The Context

In a world increasingly affected by climate change, understanding weather patterns is more important than ever. This dataset included daily measurements of temperature, precipitation, and humidity across several years.

---

###  My Approach

I used Python with Pandas to clean and process the raw CSV file. I then used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations and highlight key patterns, including:

- Monthly average temperatures  
- Year-over-year comparison of precipitation  
- Extreme weather days (heatwaves, cold snaps)  
- Rolling averages for smoothed seasonal trends

---

###  Key Findings

- **July and August** showed the highest average temperatures each year  
- **Rainfall increased significantly in late spring and early fall**  
- A noticeable **upward trend in annual average temperature** — possible climate shift  
- A few days in winter had **unexpected temperature spikes** — potential data quality issues or outliers worth further investigation

###  What This Project Demonstrates

This project shows my ability to:

- Clean and structure real-world datasets  
- Apply analytical thinking to identify trends and anomalies  
- Create compelling data visuals to support clear storytelling  
- Use Python as a tool to generate insights, not just code

---

###  Next Steps

I’d like to expand this project by adding geospatial data or comparing multiple cities to understand regional differences.
