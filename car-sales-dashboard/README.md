###  The Business Question:
How can we optimize production and dealer investment in 2025 based on past sales and profit performance?

---

## Tools Used
- Looker Studio  
- Google Sheets

---

###  Key Findings:

- **Hudson** emerged as the top-selling model with over **20,000 units sold**, generating a significant portion of total profit.
- **Dealer 1288** achieved the **highest individual profit** of **$9.8M**, standing out as a strong performer.
- The **year 2023** marked a **peak in total profit**, indicating positive sales momentum post-COVID.
- Three models â€” **Salish**, **Labrador**, and **Hudson** â€” contributed to over **65% of total profit**, showing clear product concentration.
- Despite stable unit sales, **average quantity per dealer remained flat**, suggesting room to optimize regional distribution.

---

###  What This Means for Business:

These insights can help the company:

- **Prioritize the Hudson model** for production in 2025  
- **Allocate more resources** to high-performing dealers like 1288  
- Consider **phasing out or redesigning** underperforming models (e.g., Champlain)  
- **Refine sales strategies** in lower-performing regions by analyzing dealer-level data further

---

###  Dashboard Design Choices:

- **Bar charts** show the balance between profit and units sold over time  
- A **donut chart** highlights profit distribution by model â€” ideal for identifying top performers  
- A **dealer performance chart** helps management quickly identify whoâ€™s contributing the most  
- **Interactive filters** let users explore model or dealer-specific views without overwhelming them

###  Final Thoughts:

This dashboard doesnâ€™t just show numbers â€” it **tells a story** about whatâ€™s working, whatâ€™s not, and where action can create the most value. Itâ€™s a tool for **strategic planning**, not just reporting.
